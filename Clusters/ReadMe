The files without extensions are bash files, they need to be chmodded to executable (chmod +x [filename]).
Please read comments in the bash files before running it (you may not need to run everything in each file)

For the python packages, it's assuming you have anaconda installed. I would advise to create a new environment for those packages.

run_files lets you run the program, however if you wish to run it yourself, just copy the lines inside 
(I didn't want to bother going up twice to the previous two commands nor memorize the syntax during testing so I made a file :] )
