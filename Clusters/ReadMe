This directory focuses on algorithm implementation and improvement rather than answering a question/problem.
The MNIST dataset was used as a standard benchmark for testing algorithms.

*** NOTES *** 
The files without extensions are bash files, they need to be chmodded to executable (chmod +x [filename]).
get_updated_files gets all the files in this directory (except itself of course)
run_files lets you run the program
